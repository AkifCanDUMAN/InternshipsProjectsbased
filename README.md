What is the parking sensor with Arduino, how to make an arduino car parking sensor, I will be giving the answer to all of these in the next part of the article. But before we go into the article, let's talk a little bit about what a parking sensor is.

Simply put, parking sensors are distance sensors designed to warn the driver inside the vehicle by detecting obstacles around the vehicle at the time of parking.

Parking sensors are products that are already on sale. The issue that interests us in this article is how we can make a parking sensor using an arduino and a distance sensor. The incoming data is evaluated by a sensor that performs continuous distance control. Buzzer and/or led will be active according to the range of distance. It is not easy to describe this in writing. You will understand more clearly in the source code and the related video. Then if you're ready, let's start by getting to know the arduino parking sensor materials.
